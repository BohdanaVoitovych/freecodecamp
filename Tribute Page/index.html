          User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence
          <br />the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams,
          the product manager <br />(or product owner in Scrum), <br />
          is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing
          them into<br />
          a product backlog.In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User
          stories can be <br />developed through discussion with stakeholders,
          based on personas or simply made up.

        <h2 id="headline">Here`re some interesting things we`ve found:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong> - Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3
            project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise
            for a conversation."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999</strong> - Kent Beck published the first edition of the
            book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming
            and the usage of user stories in the planning game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> - Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula
            for user story creation:
          </li>
          <li>
            The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to
            hold the concepts;
          </li>
          <li>
            The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users,
            developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by
            documentation;
          </li>
          <li>
            The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation
            have been reached.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> - The XP team at Connextra in London devised
            the user story format and shared examples with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004</strong> - Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user
            stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied:
            For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard
            reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names
            Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a
            team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the
            invention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - After a first article in 2005 and a blog
            post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping
            technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the
            identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give
            better visibility to their interdependence.
