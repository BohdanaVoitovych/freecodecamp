                Fireworks are a class of low explosive pyrotechnic devices used for aesthetic and entertainment purposes.
                The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display
                (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced by firework devices.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke,
                and floating materials (confetti for example). They may be designed to burn with colored flames
                and sparks including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and silver. Displays are common
                throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.

                  Fireworks are generally classified as to where they perform, either as a ground or aerial firework;

                <li>
                  In the latter case they may provide their own propulsion (skyrocket) or be shot into the air by a mortar
                  (aerial shell).

                Safety meens improper use of fireworks that may be dangerous, both to the person operating them (risks of
                burns and wounds) and to bystanders; in addition, they may start fires after landing on flammable material.

                  Safety of fireworks are also a problem for animals, both domestic and wild, which can be frightened by their
                  noise;

              Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume
              parties, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing
              pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, as well as watching horror films.
              Children go in costume from house to house, asking for treats such as candy or sometimes money, with the
              question,
              <code>"Trick or treat?" The word "trick" implies a "threat" to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.
          </code>
              The practice is said to have roots in the medieval practice of mumming, which is closely related to souling.

              Fireworks celebrations throughout the world, what are they? Various events around the world use fireworks as
              part of their celebrations. Fireworks become a key way to mark occasions, and have been used for celebrations
              for thousands of years, or at least since the Ancient Chinese era. While some celebrations are well known, such
              as Bonfire Night in the UK, or Independence Day in the United States, other celebrations are slightly more
              unusual.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              All, however, use fireworks such as black cat fireworks as a key part of demonstrations and festivities, and
              take the opportunity to put on spectacular displays.

                United States earliest settlers brought their enthusiasm for fireworks to the United States. Fireworks and
                black ash were used to celebrate important events long before the American Revolutionary War.

              <p>Here are some common fireworks classes:</p>

                      Class 1.2G (Projection but not mass explosion:Pyrotechnics) UN0334 Fireworks (Rarely used);

              Fireworks tubes are made by rolling thick paper tightly around a former, such as a dowel.
              <br>They can be made by hand, most firework factories use machinery to manufacture tubes. Whenever tubes are
              used in fireworks, at least one end is always plugged with clay to keep both chemicals and burning gases from
              escaping through that end. The tooling is always made of non-sparking materials such as aluminium or brass.
              Experts at handling explosives, called pyrotechnicians, add chemicals for special effects.

              Uses other than public displays in addition to large public displays, people often buy small amounts of
              fireworks for their own celebrations. Fireworks on general sale are usually less powerful than professional
              fireworks.
              Types include: <code>rockets, cakes (multishot aerial fireworks) and smoke balls.</code>Fireworks can also be
              used in an agricultural capacity as bird scarers.
              <p>
                Fireworks Types:
              </p>
              <code>
          Bouquet Pattern, Bottle Rocket, Black Powder.
      </code>
              <p>
                Sometimes referred to as "repeaters" or "multi-shot aerials", a cake is an item that has a single fuse which
                is used to light several tubes in sequence. Cakes can have a variety of
                intricate aerial effects, including spinners, fish, flower bouquets, comets, crossettes, and other elements.
                Cakes are the most popular consumer fireworks item outside of
                sparklers and firecrackers:
              </p>
      
              <code>
          Chrysanthemum, Confetti, Consumer Fireworks, Crackle Effect.
      </code>
      
              <p>
                A type of fireworks that can be enjoyed better during the day time than the night time. Includes smoke items
                and parachute items:
              </p>
      
              <code>

              <code>
          Mine, Missile, Mortar, Multi-Shot Aerial.

              <code>
          Snaps, snakes, poppers, and (sometimes) sparklers.

                Colors in fireworks are usually generated by pyrotechnic stars—usually just called stars—which produce intense
                light when ignited. Stars contain five basic types of ingredients:

              <ul>
                <li>

                  An oxidizer—a compound that combines with the fuel to produce intense heat;

                <li>
                  Color-producing salts (when the fuel itself is not the colorant);

              Pollution of using fireworks is realy bad. Fireworks produce smoke and dust that may contain residues of heavy
              metals, sulfur-coal compounds and some low concentration toxic chemicals. These by-products of fireworks
              combustion will vary depending on the mix of ingredients of a particular firework. The color green, for
              instance, may be produced by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                adding the various compounds;
